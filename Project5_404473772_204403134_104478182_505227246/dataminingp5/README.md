# DataMiningP5
To run this code according to the problem specification, simply enter the following command in terminal:
>> \>> python \*.py\*

Note that some codes are written in jupyter scripts and others in python scripts. The jupyter notebooks require the installation of Jupyter and running the following command from the working directory of the python files, reveals the jupyter scripts:
>> \>> jupyter notebook

The coding has been done in Python 3 and the project is a contribution of Pavan Holur, Donna Branchevsky, Ravi Reddy, and Megan Williams. It was done for project 5 in Introduction to Large-Scale Data Mining - ECE 219 in Winter 2019.
